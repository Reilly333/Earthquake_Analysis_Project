EARTHQUAKE PROJECT-2 INTRODUCTRIAL PROPOSAL

Our group has decided upon requesting an API from USGS.gov to pull past last 100 years of earthquake/ typhoon data in the world, into a dataframe in python pandas.
It is expected to contain > 20000 occurrences (rows), with variables (columns) of date, xy location, and magnitude.
A library must be imported to transcribe the epoctime, into Eurpean time.
This data will be cleaned by sorting out the earthquakes which occur in the world, at a certain significant magnitude.
This will then be pushed to SQLpostgres, in the flask app, to create a sufficient database.
Tables will be created in postgres of Jan 01, 1919- Dec 31 1969 and Jan 01, 1970 - present of the occurrences of >= 3 magnitude earthquakes, during those times.
These tables will be imported and visualized in Tableau to display a time lapse point map of the United States during these 2 periods,.
The diameter of each point will indicate frequency, while the color will indicate the magnitude of the occurrence.
These visualizations, along with a brief background in fault plate tectonics will be connected to python flask for presentation.
The presentation will be based around understanding the change in frequency, magnitude, and location of these earthquakes.
Hopefully this data will provide an understanding of future trends.
